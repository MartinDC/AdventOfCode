# AdventOfCode 2019
My solutions for Advent of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/)

# Usage
Step one is to build from source. 
In a terminal run the following commands:

```
    npm install
    npm run build
```

Open **index.html** after running the npm build script(best viewed in Chrome >= 79). 

You will be presented with a UI to enter your puzzle input, and navigate between calendar days and parts. 
Dont forget to enter your input before selecting a problem!

# Where are the solutions?
Each of the problems are found in source/components, split after what day they appeared in the calendar.

# What is the extra code?
I built a small harness/helper around the input parsing, and of course there is the UI part!
This does NOT follow YAGNI :)
